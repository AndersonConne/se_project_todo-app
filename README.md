# Simple Todo App

This the sprint 7 project for the software engineering program at triple ten. It's just a simple todo website.

## Functionality

With this website you can set yourself a todo list with an optional date for completion. It uses the Object Oreniented programming paradigm.

## Technology

I refactored the code so that it uses classes instead of only functions.
I used the Todo.js class to refactor the generateTodo function.
I also used the FormValidator to refractor the Validation file.
